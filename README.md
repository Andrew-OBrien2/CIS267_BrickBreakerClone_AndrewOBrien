This is a clone of the game "Brick Breaker." Your goal is to destroy all of the bricks, but make sure not to miss the ball!

The controls are the left and right arrow keys.

Bricks have a chance to drop power ups, but be careful, as they might throw you off. The power ups are:
1. Increased damage - You deal double damage to bricks for 5 seconds.
2. Speed boost - Your paddle has double the normal speed for 5 seconds.
3. Inversion - Left and right movement is flipped for 5 seconds.

There is a chance for metal bricks to spawn. These are indestructable and do not give points or drop power ups.

Bricks spawn in a predefined layout, but have a random health state assigned to them.

All assets (and code) were created by me.
